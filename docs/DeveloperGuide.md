### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

TThe UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of multiple parts:
* `CommandBox` - Handles user input
* `ResultDisplay` - Shows feedback to user
* `PersonListPanel` - Displays list of persons
* `SupplyOrderListPanel` - Displays list of supply orders
* `CustomerOrderListPanel` - Displays list of customer orders
* `StatusBarFooter` - Shows save location status

All these components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which encapsulates common functionality for UI components.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `SupplyOrder`, and `CustomerOrder` objects residing in the `Model`.

Key features:
* Handles window management (showing, hiding, sizing)
* Provides keyboard shortcuts through accelerators
* Implements error handling and displays alerts when needed
* Supports refresh functionality to update all UI components
* Manages help window functionality

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)
![StorageDiagram.png](images%2FStorageDiagram.png)
[StorageClassDiagram.puml](diagrams%2FStorageClassDiagram.puml)


The `Storage` component manages data persistence by saving and loading various parts of the application's data in JSON format. It handles the following components: `AddressBook`, `UserPrefs`, `SupplyOrderList`, `CustomerOrderList`, `IngredientCatalogue`, and `PastryCatalogue`.

#### **Responsibilities**
1. **Saving Data**: Converts in-memory objects from the `Model` component into JSON format and writes them to disk.
2. **Loading Data**: Reads data from JSON files and converts them back into in-memory objects used by the `Model` component.
3. **Error Handling**: Provides robust mechanisms to handle missing files, corrupt data, and deserialization errors.
4. **Interface Implementation**: Implements multiple storage interfaces to handle the different types of data:
    - `AddressBookStorage`
    - `UserPrefsStorage`
    - `SupplyOrderListStorage`
    - `CustomerOrderListStorage`
    - `IngredientCatalogueStorage`
    - `PastryCatalogueStorage`

#### **Key Interfaces and Classes**
| Interface/Class                     | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `StorageManager`                    | Central manager that implements the `Storage` interface and handles all storage operations.   |
| `JsonUserPrefsStorage`              | Implements `UserPrefsStorage`. Handles saving and loading of user preferences.               |

| `JsonPastryCatalogueStorage`        | Implements `PastryCatalogueStorage`. Handles saving and loading of `PastryCatalogue`.        |

### **JSON-Adapted Classes and Their Usage**
Each data type uses specialized `JsonAdapted` classes to handle JSON serialization and deserialization. These classes ensure data consistency and validate constraints during data conversion.

| **JSON-Adapted Class**              | **Used By (JSON Classes)**           | **Purpose**                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `JsonAdaptedPerson`                 | `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, `JsonAdaptedSupplyOrder`, `JsonAdaptedCustomerOrder` | Represents a `Person` in JSON format for serialization.  |
| `JsonAdaptedIngredient`             | `JsonAdaptedPastry`, `JsonAdaptedSupplyOrder` | Represents an `Ingredient` in JSON format.  |
| `JsonAdaptedPastry`                 | `JsonAdaptedCustomerOrder` | Represents a `Pastry` in JSON format.            |

### Storage Workflow

1. **Application Startup**:
    - The `MainApp` initializes the `StorageManager`.
    - The `StorageManager` loads data from JSON files.
    - If data files are missing or corrupted, the application falls back to sample data.

2. **User Interaction**:
    - Users interact with the application through commands.
    - Upon successful command execution, updated data is saved via `StorageManager`.

3. **Application Shutdown**:
    - The `MainApp` ensures all modified data is saved before closing.
    - This includes saving the current state of User Preferences, Address Book, Ingredient Catalogue, Pastry Catalogue, Customer Orders, and Supply Orders.

#### **Data Flow**
1. **Saving Data**:
    - When data is modified, `Model` notifies `StorageManager`.
    - `StorageManager` converts the data to JSON and saves it using the respective storage class.

2. **Loading Data**:
    - On startup, `StorageManager` reads data from JSON files.
    - The data is deserialized into in-memory objects and passed to the `Model`.

### Error Handling

The `Storage` component employs robust error handling to manage potential issues:
- **DataLoadingException**:
    - Thrown when data loading fails due to corruption or format issues.
    - The application uses sample data in such cases.

- **IOException**:
    - Thrown during file read/write operations.
    - Errors are logged, and users are notified.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add/Delete Order feature

#### Implementation
The order management mechanism is facilitated by `CustomerOrderList` and `SupplyOrderList`. Both classes extends `OrderList` with methods to add and manage orders. Additionally, it implements the following operations:  
* `CustomerOrderList#addOrder(Order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a new customer order to the customer order list.
* `CustomerOrderList#removeOrder(Order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes an existing order from the customer order list.
* `SupplyOrderList#addOrder(Order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a new supply order to the supply order list.
* `SupplyOrderList#removeOrder(Order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes an existing supply order from the supply order list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addCustomerOrder(Order)`, `Model#removeCustomerOrder(Order)`, `Model#removeCustomerOrder(Order)` and `Model#removeSupplyOrder(Order)` respectively.  

**Adding an Order**
* Given below is an example usage scenario on how the order management mechanism behaves at each step when an order is added. 
* For simplicity, we will only focus on the customer order list since both customer and supply order lists share the same behavior. 

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The `CustomerOrderList` will be initialized with the initial order list state.  

Step 2: The user executes `addCustomerOrder` command to add a new customer order. 

Command Execution:  
* The execute method is called with the `Model` as a parameter.
* It retrieves the `PastryCatalogue` from the `Model`.
* It checks if all product IDs in the `idList` exist in the `PastryCatalogue`.
* It retrieves the list of products corresponding to the IDs.
* It retrieves the list of persons from the `Model`.
* It checks if the person exists in the list by their phone number.
* If the person does not exist, it creates a new guest person and adds them to the `Model`.
* It creates a new `CustomerOrder` with the person, product list, order status, and remark.
* It adds the order to the person and the `CustomerOrderList` within `Model`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `AddCustomerOrderCommand` during the execution of the `addCustomerOrder` command:
![AddCustomerOrderSequenceDiagram.png](images/AddCustomerOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

**Deleting an Order**
* An example of how the order management mechanism behaves at each step when an order is removed is given below. 
* Once again only the customer order list will be focused on.

Step 1: The user executes `deleteCustomerOrder` command to remove an existing customer order.

Command Execution:  
* The execute method is called with the `Model` as a parameter.
* It retrieves the `CustomerOrderList` from the `Model`.
* It checks if the provided index is valid (1-based index).
* It retrieves the order at the specified index.
* It retrieves the person associated with the order.
* It removes the order from the person.
* It removes the order from the `CustomerOrderList`.
* It returns a `CommandResult` indicating the success of the operation.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the DeleteCustomerOrderCommand during the execution of the deleteCustomerOrder command.
![DeleteCustomerOrderSequenceDiagram.png](images/DeleteCustomerOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Storage of Orders**  
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store orders in a JSON file.  
  * Pros: Easy to implement and maintain.
  * Cons: May not be efficient for large datasets.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Store orders in a database.  
  * Pros: More efficient for large datasets, supports complex queries.
  * Cons: Requires additional setup and maintenance.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
